# GRPC API

The GRPC api mirrors the HTTP api.

The proto files are located at [https://github.com/bcc-code/bible-server/tree/master/proto](https://github.com/bcc-code/bible-server/tree/master/proto)   
Some compiled file for gRPC are provided  \(go, c\#\), but currently not yet really in use. Feel free to test!
